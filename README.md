## About

Truqui is a web-app that helps you to keep count your score in a "Truco" match, it is not necessary to install anything, you can play in the web and we use redux persist to save all the data along the time.

FOR NOW THE APPLICATION IS MOBILE-ONLY (The responsive design at desktop view is not optimal)

## Changelog
